# Data Analysis

Different datasets that I analyzed and visualized. I will try to gain insights from the data
and apply the knowedge to apply machine learning to these problems. 

## Covid19:
    
    Analysis of the Covid19 dataset about the spread of the virus. The dataset contains current information new infections and deaths by country and time. I will add a data pipeline soon and stop reading from excel. 


## Price Prediction:

    My take on data analysis of the kaggle competition [Predict future sales](https://www.kaggle.com/c/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales/). I will likely add a prediction algorithm soon.
