My take on data analysis of the kaggle competition [Predict future sales](https://www.kaggle.com/c/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales/). I will likely add a prediction algorithm soon.

Thanks to [minhtriet](https://www.kaggle.com/minhtriet) and [kyakovlev](https://www.kaggle.com/kyakovlev) for the great inroduction to data analysis on this topic.
